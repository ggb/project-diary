After almost three month I've finally accomplished to finish [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com), a free course by Wes Bos. I learned a lot and I had a lot of fun on the way, so I can really recommend this course to everyone interested in JavaScript or client side web programming. I think I'll even take another course by Wes Bos about ES6, called [ES6 for everyone](https://es6.io/). I am familiar with almost all topics covered, but I am quite sure that there are lots of small gems to discover. 

Additionally, to get a better grasp on modern JavaScript infrastructure, I today started a course called [Building a JavaScript Development Environment](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/javascript-development-environment) by Cory House which is hosted on PluralSight.
