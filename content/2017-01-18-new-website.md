Today I've created my new website (i. e. **this** website). I thought about using Wordpress, because their are tons of themes, it is easy to set up and super easy to write new blog posts. I ended creating my own minimalistic theme (which is in fact inspired by [Steve Dekortes](http://www.dekorte.com/blog/2012) blog) for python Pelican. [Pelican](https://www.getpelican.com/) is a static page creation tool and it has all I've wanted: Easy to setup, super customizable, markdown blog posts.
