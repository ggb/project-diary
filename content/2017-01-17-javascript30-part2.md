So far I've watched seven or eight JavaScript 30-tutorials and I think it is time for some first impressions. Long story short: The course is great and I enjoy it a lot. I've learned some nice new tricks:

* I knew about the [spreading operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator) before, but to see it in action helps to get a feeling for the use cases.
* Same applies for [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment). E. g. to flip vars you can simply use [fst, snd] = [snd, fst]
* [Template strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) are available in many other languages like Elixir or Ruby. I hope for wide-spread browser support in the near future.
* [Document.querySelector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector) isn't a new feature, but I've seldom used it and wasn't aware how handy it is
* The [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) is a nice shortcut for gathering data.
