Today I've started with [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com), a free online course on some intermediate and advanced features of JavaScript. The couse doesn't use any libraries or frameworks, it's just ES6 and modern browser APIs. 

To be honest, I have a love-hate-relationship to JavaScript. I hope to learn some new and shiny and cool things.
