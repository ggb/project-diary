I really like the aesthetics of pixel art, maybe because I played the good old Lucas Arts adventure games a lot. To produce pixel art on my own is a skill I would love to master (or at least be a litte proficient in). So I was happy when I discovered [this course](https://www.udemy.com/learn-to-create-pixel-art-for-your-game/learn/v4/overview) on Udemy, together with the new years offer of Udemy: Every course for only 10 â‚¬. 

The first thing you create is a pixel person:

My aim was to make the pixel person look like Henry David Thoreau, as he is depicted on [this comic cover](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27132988-thoreau).
