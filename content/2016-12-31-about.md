*I visualize data at my job.*

I work at [graphomate](http://www.graphomate.com/), where I design and develop applications for data visualization. At my job I use JavaScript (with [d3.js](https://d3js.org/)), [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Elm](http://www.elm-lang.org), but sometimes also Java, C# and Python. 

*I like simplicity.*

That's why I prefer Functional Programming most of the time, e. g. with Elm, [Elixir](http://www.http://elixir-lang.org/) and [F#](http://www.fsharp.org). 

I've created a couple of small Elm example applications (zozozombies [[code]](https://github.com/ggb/zozozombies), RegisterMachine [[code]](https://gist.github.com/ggb/d528132e9293d43e0cc0), LunarLander [[code]](https://gist.github.com/ggb/edcda03567f9e6700d39), Particle [[code]](https://gist.github.com/ggb/2b3f831a41af4288cb39440fbc8a793e), Maze) and a handful of libraries ([numeral-elm](https://github.com/ggb/numeral-elm), [elm-sentiment](https://github.com/ggb/elm-sentiment), [elm-trend](https://github.com/ggb/elm-trend), [porterstemmer](https://github.com/ggb/porterstemmer)). I've talked about Elm at [BOB2016](http://bobkonf.de/2016/grosse-boelting.html) and am one of the organizers of Elmoin ([GitHub](https://github.com/elmoin), [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Elmoin/)), the Elm Meetup for Hamburg and Schleswig Holstein. 

*I like to mine text.*

Although in a front-end role at the moment, my background, expertise and interest is in text mining. 

I wrote my [master thesis](https://www.kd.informatik.uni-kiel.de/en/bsc-msc-theses/accomplished-topics/msc-thesis-grosse-bolting) (with Elixir) on multi-label classification of scientific articles. My work led to two publications ([ICSC15](http://ansgarscherp.net/publications/pdf/C42-GrosseBoeltingNishiokaScherp-Generic%20Process%20for%20Extracting%20User%20Profiles%20from%20Social%20Media%20using%20Hierarchical%20Knowledge%20Bases-preprint.pdf), [K-CAP15](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2815838)) and was awarded with the ["Prof. Petersen Preis der Technik"](http://www.petersen-stiftung.de/index-Dateien/Page1001.htm).
