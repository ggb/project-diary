Doing animations with CSS and SVG is quite fascinating. It is a relativly new technology with lots of potential and it uses many things I am already firm with (JS, CSS and SVG). 

I was quite happy when I found a [free course](https://www.udemy.com/learn-svg-animation/learn/v4) on Udemy that teaches SVG animations. It is a short course with only two hours of videos, but a nice one. The focus of the course is to produce assets that could be used on a "normal" website, like animated buttons and logos.

First exercise: An animated logo.

The basic logo is just a colored circle with white text, the font used is [Googles Pacifico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico). [Link to the Pen](http://codepen.io/ggb/pen/apOWdY).
