Today I've finished the rest of the course on SVG animation. I've created some nice [social buttons](http://codepen.io/ggb/pen/bgdKXW) (animation on hover)

as well as this [useless but nice thing](http://codepen.io/ggb/pen/rjVryP)

Learnings:

* SVG animations are quite powerful
* browser support isn't as good as expected. Only Chrome does everything right. Firefox has e. g. problems with SVG and the transform-origin CSS property
* it's a technology to keep in mind to produce "WOW effects"
