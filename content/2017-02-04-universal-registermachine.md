I just updated [some old Elm code](https://gist.github.com/ggb/d528132e9293d43e0cc0) from 0.17 to 0.18. The code is used to simulate a Universal Register Machine, the gif below shows the edition of two numbers. If you would like to run your own URM-code just change the program inside the Elm snippet and update the registers as you like.

I sketched this program while I was listening to the presentation at ClojureD. I think it is a powerful and seldom recognized feature of Elm, that it is easy to visualize things, e. g. complex behaviors.
