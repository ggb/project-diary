I already wrote a rather lengthy blog post on the Bob Konf, so I'll keep this one short: A day after Bob I attended this years [ClojureD](http://www.clojured.de/schedule/), a conference in Berlin (in a new, beautiful location) dedicated to the beloved LISP-dialect on the JVM. The talks I liked the most were "Writing Clojure at Runtime with Nightlight" by Zach Oakes, "The Elements of Style in Programming" by Bozhidar Batsov and "Making video games and learning Clojure" by Lisa Passing. I can warmly recommend to watch all these talks on Youtube as soon as the recordings are available. I think I will discuss the last one in greater detail on a later occasion as I plan to try some of the presented frameworks and libraries on my own.
